# Linkak:

**This project is going to be a URL shortener with Python and Django framework.**

---
## What is URL Shortener in general:
URL shortening is a technique on the World Wide Web in which a Uniform Resource
Locator (URL) may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required
page. This is achieved by using a redirect which links to the web page that has a
long URL. For example, the URL "https://example.com/assets/category_B/F/" can
be shortened to "https://example.com/F", and the URL "https://en.wikipedia.org/"
can be shortened to "https://w.wiki/". Often the redirect domain name is shorter
than the original one.
